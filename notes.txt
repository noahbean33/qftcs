1. Core Framework Components
The library must implement the categorical structure of AQFT, focusing on the categories Loc (globally hyperbolic spacetimes) and Alg (unital *-algebras), and support the functorial definition of locally covariant QFTs.
Category Classes:
Loc Category:
Class to represent globally hyperbolic spacetimes 
\boldsymbol{M} = (\mathcal{M}, g, \mathfrak{o}, \mathfrak{t})
, where:
\mathcal{M}
: Smooth manifold (support for arbitrary dimension (n), typically 4, with finitely many connected components).
(g): Lorentzian metric with signature 
(+,-,-,-)
.
\mathfrak{o}
: Orientation (represented by a nowhere-zero smooth (n)-form).
\mathfrak{t}
: Time-orientation (represented by a nowhere-zero smooth (g)-timelike 1-form).
Methods to validate global hyperbolicity (e.g., existence of Cauchy surfaces).
Morphisms: Smooth, isometric embeddings 
\psi: \boldsymbol{M} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{N}
 preserving orientation and time-orientation with causally convex images.
Functionality to check causal convexity of the image 
\psi(\boldsymbol{M})
.
Alg Category:

\boldsymbol{M} \in \mathbf{Loc}
.
Assign a *-homomorphism 
\mathscr{A}(\psi): \mathscr{A}(\boldsymbol{M}) \rightarrow \mathscr{A}(\boldsymbol{N})
 for each morphism 
\psi: \boldsymbol{M} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{N}
.
Ensure functoriality: 
\mathscr{A}(\psi \circ \varphi) = \mathscr{A}(\psi) \circ \mathscr{A}(\varphi)
 and 
\mathscr{A}(\mathrm{id}_{\boldsymbol{M}}) = \mathrm{id}_{\mathscr{A}(\boldsymbol{M})}
.

O_1 \subset O_2
, then 
\mathscr{A}^{\text{kin}}(\boldsymbol{M}; O_1) \subset \mathscr{A}^{\text{kin}}(\boldsymbol{M}; O_2)
.
Handle unions and intersections (e.g., 
\mathscr{A}^{\text{kin}}(\boldsymbol{M}; O_1 \cup O_2)
 contains the algebra generated by 
\mathscr{A}^{\text{kin}}(\boldsymbol{M}; O_1)
 and 
\mathscr{A}^{\text{kin}}(\boldsymbol{M}; O_2)
